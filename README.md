# Digital Time Capsule

Author: Sebastian Madriz

## Project Overview

This project is a multi-page website that is a digital time capsule of how Sebastian Madriz uses the internet as of September 2023. It has a brief introduction on who he is, what kind of things he likes/is interested in, and how these likes/interests may manifest themselves as activity through the internet.

## Technical Overview

The website was published using Github Pages.

All of the sites were coded with HTML and CSS using Visual Studio Code.

The moving text, and the spinning logo present in some of the backgrounds of the website were created using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects.

The illustration present on the About page was sketched on SketchbookÂ®.

All of the embeded links were code that the linked sites provided.

## Ackowledgement

The navigation bar was created thanks to this helpful tutorial on Youtube by a creator that goes by CodeNewbies: https://youtu.be/ZbiPx_9xr5c?si=V4eNw1j0DClHViEK

The spinning logo pattern for the background of the websites wouldn't have been made without the help of this tutorial by 
Smertimba Graphics on Youtube: https://youtu.be/hjcmafZQqHg?si=Oq2FnhAvfUv_5y8y

The layout on the Likes page of the website wouldn't have been possible without the code provided in this youtube tutorial by Muhammad Irshad: https://youtu.be/vIaduyqHPfY?si=uHYAzO-PYHcuBkCx

For the secret added dinosaur jump game I found and used this code by @MysticReborn on Codepen: https://codepen.io/MysticReborn/pen/rygqao/

Thank you to all of the social media companies that provided the code through their websites to embed parts of their website onto my own.

And thank you to professor Josh Oakley for his Web Design course as San Francisco State University for the foundations and the knowledge that allowed me program the majority of the website and combine outside resources into the Digital Time Capsule website.
