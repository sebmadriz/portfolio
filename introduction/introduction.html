                    a. He doesn't actually look like this in real life...this is just an artistic
                    interpretation of him.<br><br>
                    First off, he does have ears. I know it may seems like he doesn't, but trust me, he does. And not
                    only does he have ears...but he has hair too!
                </p>

            <div class="introduction-p" id="introduction-c">
                <p>
                    b. Yes he's built like a dorito in<br>
                    real life. Some would even say greek god including myself.<br><br>
                    You can trust my opinion. I'm an unbiased narrator in your
                    head<br><br>
                    No, his fingers aren't the size of his legs, and yes he has
                    normal shaped fingers. Honestly, I don't know what Sebastian
                    was doing when he made his hands and fingers look like this.

                <p>
                    c. Yes, he does have this beautiful smile!
                    I bet you thought he was bald for a second. That only happens
                    every couple years when he gets a buzz haircut, but as of right
                    now he does have hair.
                </p>

                    d. Now for the interesting bits of information: He is a student
                    at San Francisco State University. He has a passion for odd
                    and disruptive looking design (This website is evidence of
                    that). And in his professional life he's looking forward to
                    working with a design firm as a graphic designer someday. Furthermore,
                    he enjoys using fancy words. And outside of design he's a big fan
                    of body- building and NBA basketball.<br><br>
                    Oh and wherever he is, he hopes you enjoy the rest of the website!
